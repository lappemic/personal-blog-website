summary: 'People worth following and reading their blogs'

I copied this from [Patrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/) who [lists people](https://patrickcollision.com/people) who blog/write online and he likes to read from. I think this is a cool idea and will do the same here. It is going to be a living list where i add more people over time.
