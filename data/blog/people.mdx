summary: 'People worth following and reading their blogs'
---

I copied this from Patrick Collison who [lists people](https://patrickcollision.com/people) who blog/write online and he likes to read from. I think this is a cool idea and will do the same here. It is going to be a living list where i add more people over time. If one of the people below has a subsite where they share their book recommendations, this site is listed on [here](https://michaelscheiwiller.com/bookshelves).
