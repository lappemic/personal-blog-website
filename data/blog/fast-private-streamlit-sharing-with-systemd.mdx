**This is a follow up to [Legal RAG with Streamlit, ChromaDB and OpenAI](https://michaelscheiwiller.com/blog/legal-rag-streamlit-chromadb-openai)**

If you want to share a Streamlit app with someone who is not technical and can not clone and build the app on their own, you have to provide them somehow with a link they can access to use the app and give you feedback. For Streamlit apps whichs repos are public, this is easily done with [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).

But if you want to keep the repo private, you have to host the app somewhere. One of the easiest ways to do this i found to use a VPS and run the app as a systemd service (check [this post](https://michaelscheiwiller.com/blog/setting-up-new-server) for a vps setup guide). This post details how i set it up.

# Running as a systemd Service

To keep the Streamlit app running in the background and automatically restart it if it fails, you can set it up as a systemd service.

1. **Create the service file directly in `/etc/systemd/system`:**

```sh
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/streamlit.service
```

2. **Paste the following content (edit paths as needed):**

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Streamlit App
After=network.target

[Service]
User=devuser
WorkingDirectory=/home/devuser/projects/test-rag
ExecStart=/home/devuser/projects/test-rag/.venv/bin/streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501 --server.address 0.0.0.0
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. **Enable and start the service:**

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable streamlit
sudo systemctl start streamlit
```

4. **Check the status:**

```sh
sudo systemctl status streamlit
```

The app will now run in the background and restart automatically if it crashes. You can access it at `http://YOUR_VPS_IP:8501/`.
