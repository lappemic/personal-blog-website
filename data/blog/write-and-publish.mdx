summary: "I'm starting a weekly writing and publishing habit"

I used to write because I had to. Now, I am choosing to write because I want to.

Although it feels really strange I am going to write on this blog from today on. I commit to writing at least one 'post' per week as long as I am not on holiday.

Why?

Previously I always had a part in my life in which I actually was forced to write. Either at work or university. Since June 2023 this is actually not the case anymore. Also I am freelancing and trying to build my own products since ~1 year parttime and since 4 months without another job.

I did not realize this before, but having to write always forced me more to concentrate on a given topic. Not having this anymore I feel like I am loosing my ability to properly concentrate. I tried already for some time writing notes in obsidian and thought about publishing them at some point. Upt to now this never happened. Some time ago I then published the first blogpost here about [how I set up new linux servers](https://www.michaelscheiwiller.com/blog/setting-up-new-server). I somehow enjoyed the process of writing this and then actually publishing it. Not that I really think that it will have an impact on anybodies life, but I know it is out there and potentially can help someone motivated me. Also I realized how much more it stuck with me.

This process made me realize what others propagate already for a long time: Writing helps to think and form new ideas [1][2][3]. Furthermore if you then publish your writings in any form and put it out for others to read and interact with, you get feedback on which greatly can help you further improve your writing and therefore your thinking and ideas [4][5].

Currently I am stil on the edge about writng here versus directly just writing on [X.com](https://x.com). But the platform risk and not owning the data are strong reasons for me to write here. For now, i am sticking to this blog to own my work, but will share it on X for feedback. Funnily enough [levels just wrote today](<(https://x.com/levelsio/status/1905582561667232074)>) that a lot of the early bloggers stopped writing new posts.

It will pretty sure get messy about topics since it will be mix about stuff which interests me. And since I like a broad range of topics but nowhere really am an expert in, the topics will be widespread. I try not to hold me back if I want to write on something.

Also the posts itself will get messy since I am not yet very good at writing and will not refine and iterate on the post for ages. I will publish them asap and then (possibly...) iterate on them. The goal is to building fast feedback loops.

Writing and publishing weekly will hopefully help me get back into flow states and making getting faster feedback loops.
