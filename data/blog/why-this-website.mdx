summary: 'A somewhat cringe post about why i created this website.'
---

I thought quite some while already that i would like to 'build' my own website (as disclaimed in the
[About page](https://www.michaelscheiwiller.com/about) this is a template). But i always thought it is
kind of cringe to do this if you are

- not a research coryphaeus
- not a designer
- not an exceptional coder
- not a company owner
- or the like.

Additionally why should anyone care about me and my thoughts or learnings. Everybody is further and there
are experts in every field.
