summary: 'How i set up my external server'
---

I recently had to setup a server for some scheduled jobs (a scraper for [nextgenenergyjobs.com](https://nextgenenergyjobs.com]). I did it already once before. And before this once at work. And nevertheless i struggled again and had issues configuring this all. Since i am just getting familiar with using the command line and linus more and more i got problems in different areas. This is why i decided to write this down as a blog post for someone who struggles with this setup often and i have to think and document through each step. So this post is about setting up a new server (e.g [digitalocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets) or [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/)), create a new user, and grant it github access.

# Prerequisites

- A DO or Hetzner account (go to [https://www.digitalocean.com/](https://www.digitalocean.com/) or [https://www.hetzner.com/](https://www.hetzner.com/) and create one)
- SSH keys added to DO or Hetzner account (you will be prompted when you create the server)
- Basic command line knowledge (if you want to improve have a look at [your missing cs semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)

# 1. Creating the server

Choose a region, 'Ubuntu' as the OS, 'Shared CPU', 'Regular' and 'SSH Key' for the authentication method (add one if not yet added - click 'New SSH Key' for guidance if needed) and the specs (cpu, ram, etc.) you need (differ from provider to provider). It takes some seconds and then you have a running server. Copy the IP address (or ipv4), you will need this for the connection afterwards. Such a minimal server will cost you ~$5/month.

# 2. Initial SSH setup

Ensure your ssh agent has loaded your keys:

```bash
ssh-add
```

Then connect to your droplet as root:

```bash
ssh root@your.ip.address
```

# 3. Create a Secure User Account

For security reasons, we don't want to work as root. Let's create a new user account ('deployer' in my case) with sudo privileges.

```bash
# create new user (you'll be prmpted for new password - user infos like name, etc. can be left empty)
adduser deployer

# grant sudo privileges
usermod -aG sudo deployer
```

# 4. Setting up SSH access for New User

There are two ways to do it: Step by Step or the Shortcut

### 4.1 Step by Step

```bash
# create and configure .ssh directory
mkdir -p /home/deployer/.ssh
chmod 700 /home/deployer/.ssh

# set up authorized_keys file
touch /home/deployer/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 /home/deployer/.ssh/authorized_keys

# copy your public key you used on digital ocean (run this on your local machine)
cat ~/.ssh/ssh-key-used-in-do.pub

# add your key to authorized_keys (on the droplet)
echo "COPIED_PUBLIC_KEY" >> /home/deployer/.ssh/authorized_keys

# set correct ownership
chown -R deployer:deplyer /home/deployer/.ssh
```

### 4.2 Shortcut

Update with your infos and run this from your local machine:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/ssh-key-used-in-do.pub | ssh root@your.ip.address "mkdir -p /home/deployer/.ssh && cat >> /home/deployer/.ssh/authorized_keys && chown -R deployer:deployer /home/deployer/.ssh && chmod 700 /home/deployer/.ssh && chmod 600 /home/deployer/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

### 4.3 Check Configuration

Try to connect to the server:

```bash
ssh deployer@your.ip.address
```

If this connects to your server, you are good to go.

# 5. Securing SSH Access

We disable root login for better security (Claude said so):

````bash
# connect to server with new user
ssh deployer@your.ip.address

# edit ssh configuration
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# find and modify to
PermitRootLogin no

# restart the ssh service
sudo systemctl restart ssh

# 6. Settung Up GitHub Access
If you plan to work with github repositories (what else would you do?), follow these steps:
- Generate new ssh key pair
```bash
ssh-keygen
````

- Display and copy your public key

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub # or whatever key you chose
```

- Add the key to your github account:
  - go tot github settings -> ssh and gpg key
  - click 'New SSH key'
  - Paste your public key

## Notes

- if you need the root password you can get it through the password reset option in the [DO dashboard](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/) (click on your droplet > Access > Reset Root Password) (there is no other way)
- consider [adding your server to your ssh config file](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-the-ssh-known_hosts-file-on-a-vps) for easier access

## Edit
