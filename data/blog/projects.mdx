While adding [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/) to the [people](https://www.michaelscheiwiller.com/people) page i found his post [What Should You Do with Your Life? Directions and Advice](https://guzey.com/personal/what-should-you-do-with-your-life/) (which is really worth a read). The first chapter is "What to work on?". I loved this idea, especially since i lately found myself often chatting with Grok or ChatGPT about exactly this (unfortunately with not much success up to now). Since Alexey's list is somewhat outdated i thought i would make an updated one. Therefore this post.

Following a list of sources which state projects one could work on:

- Y Combinator's [Requests for Startups](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/)
- Daniel Gross's [Markets to Build](https://pioneer.app/blog/2019-frontier-markets/) (in 2019 - but some still valid)
- Tyler Cowen's [project ideas](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/12/work-on-these-things.html)
- Patrick Collisons's [Questions](https://patrickcollison.com/questions)
- Alex Guzey's [Resarch Ideas](https://guzey.com/personal/research-ideas/)

Interesting reads in this domain:

- Paul Graham's [How to Get Startup Ideas](https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)
