# 1. Introduction

In THE OTHER BLOG LINK i described how to setup streamlit and how to share it on a VPS with your customer. The issue with this approach is, you have to manually update the codebase on the vps. If you just want to share a 'final state' then this might be ok. But if you want to iterate and get feedback then this gets annoying and timeconsuming. This is why i automated this with a github webhook, flask, nginx and systemd.

# 2. Prerequisits

To be able to automate this you should have build or have access to:

- VPS (will be on Linux)
- Python, virtualenv and pip
- Nginx
- Your app hosted on github
- basic knowledge of Linux cli
- systemd

# 3. Project Structure Overview

The structure of my app is as follows (parts not relevant for this post are marked (Optional)):

```bash
.
├── app.py                       # Main Streamlit application
├── update_and_restart.sh        # Script to pull latest code and restart Streamlit
├── webhook_listener.py          # Flask app to handle GitHub webhooks
├── requirements.txt             # Python dependencies
├── .env                         # (Optional) Environment variables for Streamlit/OpenAI
├── .venv/                       # Python virtual environment
├── data/                        # (Optional) Data files for your app
├── chroma_db/                   # (Optional) ChromaDB vector store
├── scripts/                     # (Optional) Helper scripts for data processing
└── README.md                    # Project documentation
```

# 4. Deployment Workflow

Below is an extensive chart on how the deployment workflow looks like. Broken down to the main parts:

1. The user pushes a new commit to the github repository
2. Github sends a webhook to the flask app
3. The flask app pulls the latest code from the github repository
4. The flask app restarts the streamlit app

In the next section each part is explained in detail.

<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  <div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden px-2 xl:my-1 xl:w-1/2 xl:px-2">
    <img
      src="/static/images/streamlit_automated_deployment_workflow.svg"
      alt="Streamlit Automated Deployment Workflow"
      style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
    />
  </div>
</div>

# 5. Step-by-Step Setup

## 5.1 Setting Up the Streamlit App and Virtaul Environment

Clone your streamlit app to your VPS, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 5.2 Update Script

Create a bash script to pull the latest code from the github repository and restart the streamlit app (e.g. `update_and_restart.sh`). This script will be used to update the app on the VPS.

```bash:update_and_restart.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update the repository
git pull

# activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# restart the application
sudo systemctl restart streamlit
```

## 5.3 Configuring Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file to store the environment variables for the streamlit app (e.g. `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`).

```bash:.env
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-github-webhook-secret
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can generate a random secret for the github webhook secret with `python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`

## 5.4 Flask Webhook Listener

Create a flask app to handle the github webhook (e.g. `webhook_listener.py`). This app will be used to pull the latest code from the github repository and restart the streamlit app.

```python:webhook_listener.py
import hashlib
import hmac
import os
import subprocess

from flask import Flask, abort, request

app = Flask(__name__)

GITHUB_SECRET = os.environ.get("GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET", "").encode()

def verify_signature(payload, signature):
    mac = hmac.new(GITHUB_SECRET, msg=payload, digestmod=hashlib.sha256)
    expected = "sha256=" + mac.hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(expected, signature)

@app.route("/github-webhook", methods=["POST"])
def github_webhook():
    signature = request.headers.get("X-Hub-Signature-256")
    if not signature or not verify_signature(request.data, signature):
        abort(403)
    event = request.headers.get("X-GitHub-Event")
    if event == "push":
        payload = request.json
        if payload and payload.get("ref") == "refs/heads/main":
            subprocess.Popen(
                ["/bin/bash", "/home/devuser/projects/test-rag/update_and_restart.sh"]
            )
    return "", 204

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="127.0.0.1", port=9000)
```

## 5.5 Managing the Flask Listener with systemd

Create a systemd service to manage the flask listener (e.g. `streamlit-webhook-listener.service`). This service will be used to start the flask listener on boot. This file lives in `/etc/systemd/system/`.

```bash:streamlit-webhook-listener.service
  [Unit]
  Description=Flask GitHub Webhook Listener

  [Service]
  User=devuser
  WorkingDirectory=/home/devuser/projects/test-rag
  Environment=GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET='<your-github-webhook-secret>'
  ExecStart=/home/devuser/projects/test-rag/.venv/bin/python3 webhook_listener.py
  Restart=always

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## 5.6 Nginx as a Reverse Proxy

Nginx is used as a reverse proxy to handle the incoming requests to the flask app. This is done to protect the flask app from direct access from the internet. Create a nginx configuration file:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/streamlit-webhook
```

and then add the following content:

```bash:streamlit-webhook
server {
    listen 8080;
    server_name YOUR_VPS_IP;

    location /github-webhook {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000/github-webhook;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

The configuration file is then linked to the nginx sites-enabled directory:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/streamlit-webhook /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t # test the configuration
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

**Test if the nginx configuration is working**
From your VPS try the following commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
sudo netstat -tuln | grep 8080
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8080            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
```

and then try to send a request to the flask app:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9000/github-webhook
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/github-webhook
```

- The first command should hit flask directly and return some html with an 403 error (not authorized)
- The second command should hit nginx and return as well some html with an 403 error (not authorized)

> [!NOTE]
>
> 1. A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of your application and handles the incoming requests. It can be used to protect your application from direct access from the internet. (in contrast to a forward proxy which is used to access the internet)
> 2. You can find the IP of your VPS with `curl -4 ifconfig.me`

## 5.7 Open your Firewall

If you are using a VPS provider like Hetzner, you might need to open the port 8080 in the firewall.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
sudo ufw enable
```

## 5.8 Github Webhook

Create a github webhook to send a request to the flask app when a new commit is pushed to the repository.

1. Go to your github repository
2. Click on `Settings` > `Webhooks` > `Add Webhooks`
3. Set the payload URL to `http://YOUR_VPS_IP:8080/github-webhook`
4. Set the content type to `application/json`
5. Disable SSL verification
6. Set the secret to the same secret as in the `.env` file
7. Set the events to `Push`
8. Click on `Add webhook`

# 6. Test the Setup

Push a new commit to the github repository and check if the streamlit app is updated.

- Is your vps reachable from the internet?
  On your local machine try to send a request to the vps:

```bash
curl -X POST http://YOUR_VPS_IP:8080/github-webhook
```

If you get a 403 error again, you should be good to go.

# 7. Conclusion

In this blog post i showed how to automate the deployment of a streamlit app on a VPS with github webhooks, flask, nginx and systemd. This is a great way to deploy your streamlit app and keep it up to date so you can iterate and get feedback from your customers.
