Im curating the [People](https://michaelscheiwiller.com/people) page with people i like to keep on my radar for various reasons. Some of them have a separate page where they list their readings. Most do this under 'Bookshelf'.

[Last year i had the topic 'Reading'](https://x.com/mischeiwiller/status/1805216904908337404) and figured i liked it a lot and am sticking with it since. I keep a [list of books i want to read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/170458419-michael?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=to-read) on goodreads. So i thought i can do the same with recommendations from the mentioned bookshelf concept above. This is also going to be a living where i keep adding more. If you have some you like, i would love to know which ones.

If someon on the [People](https://michaelscheiwiller.com/people) site has a bookshelf type site, it is included in this list.
